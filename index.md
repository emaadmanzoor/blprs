*Berry–Levinsohn–Pakes (BLP) estimation in Rust*

`blprs` is a high-performance [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) library to estimate
demand systems of differentiated products with Berry–Levinsohn–Pakes (BLP)-type random coefficients logit models.

`blprs` is heavily inspired by [PyBLP](https://github.com/jeffgortmaker/pyblp) and the [demand estimation mixtape session](https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Demand-Estimation) by [Jeff Gortmaker](https://jeffgortmaker.com/) and Ariel Pakes.

    ⚠️ `blprs` is under active development and not intended for external use.
